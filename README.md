# Portfolio: Ken Steckler

Hi there ðŸ‘‹ I'm Ken and I am an aspiring software engineer currently pursuing a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science at Oregon State University. 

This is my first portfolio page which I created using ReactJS, NodeJS for the contact form, and used Sass to help streamline my CSS workflow.

## About

My passion in software engineering started a few years ago while in pharmacy school. I started learning basic HTML, CSS and Javascripts and made a lot of small projects in my free time.

## Documentation

I used React for my first portfolio because I wanted a simple one page web application with acnhor tags linking to certain points on the website.

The simple blue scroll button was made to navigate to the top of the website, since the navbar is fixed and does not scroll down.

Sass was used to help speed up some of the CSS design, although it can have been utilized a little more efficiently by using @mixins more frequently. I look forward to working on this in the future when I redesign my portfolio again.

I used NodeJS as my backend server to deliver form submissions directly to my email using nodemailer.

This beautiful picture of Seattle was taken by me back in 2017 a couple days before New Years. I am also a photographer and this was taken with my Sony a7II + Zeiss 55mm lens.

I am in the process of updating my portfolio website soon, this portfolio website was made last year.
