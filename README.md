# Portfolio: Ken Steckler

Hi there ðŸ‘‹ I'm Ken and I am an aspiring web developer. I am currently located in Seattle, WA. I really enjoy learning new languages and frameworks and am passionate about web development.

This is my first portfolio page which I created using ReactJS, NodeJS for the contact form, and used Sass to help streamline my CSS workflow.

## About

My passion is mostly in front end development and design, although I have experience in back end technologies as well. I love learning about different front end technologies and have learned about various ways to design the UI. Similarly, I also understand the important of creating websites that is simple and user-friendly.

## Documentation

I wanted to use React for my portfolio as my JavaScript library because I like being able to create a simple and quick one-page web application and I was mostly familiar with using React.

I was originally going to create a multi-page website that used React Routers but I eventually decided that I wanted something that was straight to the point. Instead, I simply used anchor tags to link to parts of the website.

The simple blue scroll button was made to navigate to the top of the website, since the navbar is fixed and does not scroll down.

Sass was used to help speed up some of the CSS design, although it can have been utilized a little more efficiently by using @mixins more frequently. I look forward to working on this in the future when I redesign my portfolio again.

I used NodeJS as my backend server to deliver form submissions directly to my email using nodemailer.

This beautiful picture of Seattle was taken by me back in 2017 a couple days before New Years. I am also a photographer and this was taken with my Sony a7II + Zeiss 55mm lens.
