# Portfolio: Ken Steckler

Hi there ðŸ‘‹ I'm Ken and I am an aspiring web developer. I am currently located in Seattle, WA. I really enjoy learning new languages and frameworks and am passionate about web development.

This is my first portfolio page which I created using ReactJS, NodeJS for the contact form, and used Sass to help streamline my CSS workflow.

## About

My passion is mostly in front end development and design, although I have experience in back end technologies as well. I love learning about different front end technologies and have learned about various ways to design the UI. Similarly, I also understand the important of creating websites that is simple and user-friendly.
